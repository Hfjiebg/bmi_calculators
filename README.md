# BMI Calculators

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook demonstrating how to build two Body Mass Index (BMI) calculators:

- US Units Calculator (uses pounds and inches)
- Metric Units Calculator (uses kilograms and meters).

The code follows a tutorial by Alex the Analyst and is designed to teach basic programming concepts and calculations.

## Features:

* Calculates BMI using two measurement systems: US and Metric.
* Includes user-friendly inputs and outputs.
* Demonstrates Python fundamentals such as functions, conditionals, and basic arithmetic.

## Example Outputs

### - US Units Input:

* Weight: 150 lbs
* Height: 65 inches
* BMI: 24.96

### - Metric Units Input:

* Weight: 68 kg
* Height: 1.75 m
* BMI: 22.2
